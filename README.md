# The Raven Test - In Search for Group Differences

 In this project we present the statistical analysis applied to the Raven tests results of a study conducted 
 on groups of students from different backgrounds in order to determine whether any of the two groups showed 
 significant advantages over the other.
 
 The data suffered a preprocessing for normalization and outliers removal.
 2D projections were generated to search for clear group differences.
 5 different ML models were used and compared in terms of performance.
